# Zentail V2 API Models

This repository contains all of the models used by the Zentail API
for its v2 APIs.

Currently, this is focused on the Listing and Taxonomy APIs,
but over time should grow to include the complete set of APIs for building
a complete integration.

To guide development of new Sales Channel integrations, please refer to the [guide](./guide/index.md).
