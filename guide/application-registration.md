# Application Registration

In order to build the most native feeling and maintainable integration,
Sales Channel integrations should first register as a part of Zentail's application registry.

Registration requires:

* A unique Application Name
* A Contact Email
* A Callback URI for sending authentication process communication
* A Square Logo at least 50px x 50px that can be used in the Zentail UI

Fill out 
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNXioYT2BMUFQwY8VQ5IE9L9e2HyaYWe1PQkg1qaYKPOickg/viewform) 
which will kick off the internal process of registering the app
and providing you with a clientID and clientSecret that 
will be used during the authentication flow.

Once you receive the client ID and secret,
you can proceed to the next step:
[building the OAuth flow](./authentication.md).

## Updating Regsitration

Currently, there is no Zentail UI for managing the Application.
Change requests can be submitted to [product@zentail.com](mailto:product@zentail.com).

Please include the application name and ClientID in the request.
